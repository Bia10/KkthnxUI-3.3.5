--------------------

Shefki:
	- Add fix for minimap ping not updating as you move making the ping appear to move locations as you move.
	Code originally from AntiRadarJam by Lombra, used with permission.
Xinhuan:
	- Surround the first fix (dropdown menus) by its own do-end block so that separate fixes are clear in the code.
	- Create less temporary tables in the InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToCategory() fix.
